            In the context of computing and the internet,
            hosting refers to the process of storing and serving files and data on a server that is connected to the
            internet.
            Web hosting is a type of hosting that is specifically designed to store and serve web pages and related
            files.

        <p class="page-text-content">
            When you create a website or an application, you need a place to store the files that make up the website,
            as well as a way to make those files available to users who want to access them. This is where hosting comes
            in.

        <p class="page-text-content">
            There are different types of hosting services available, depending on your needs and budget. Some common
            types of hosting include:

        <p class="page-text-content">
        <ul class="pt-2 pb-4">
            <li class="page-text-list">Shared hosting: This is when multiple websites are hosted on a single server.
                This is a cost-effective option for smaller websites that don't require a lot of resources.</li>
            <li class="page-text-list">VPS hosting: A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine that is used to
                host websites. It provides more resources and flexibility than shared hosting, but is still more
                affordable than a dedicated server.</li>
            <li class="page-text-list">Dedicated hosting: With dedicated hosting, you have an entire server to yourself.
                This provides maximum control and flexibility, but is also the most expensive option.</li>
            <li class="page-text-list">Cloud hosting: Cloud hosting is a type of hosting that uses multiple servers to
                host websites and applications. This provides scalability and flexibility, and is often used for larger
                websites and applications.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="page-text-subhead">Summary</h3>

        <p class="page-text-content">
            When choosing a hosting provider, there are several factors to consider, such as reliability, security,
            customer support, and pricing. It's important to choose a hosting provider that meets your specific needs
            and provides the level of service and support you require.
