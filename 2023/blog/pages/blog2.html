            A domain is an address on the internet that uniquely identifies a website.
            It is essentially the name that people type into their web browsers to visit a particular website.
        </p>

        <p class="page-text-content">
            Domains consist of two parts: the top-level domain (TLD) and the second-level domain.
            The TLD is the part that comes after the dot, such as .com, .org, .net, .gov, and so on.
            The second-level domain is the part that comes before the TLD,
            and it is usually the name of the company or organization that owns the website.

        </p>
        <p class="page-text-content">
            For example, in the domain name "google.com," "google" is the second-level domain and ".com" is the TLD.

        </p>
        <p class="page-text-content">
            Domains are registered and managed by domain name registrars.
            To register a domain, one needs to select an available domain name and purchase it from a registrar.
            Once the domain is registered, it can be used to host a website, create email addresses, and more.
        </p>

        <p class="page-text-content">
            Domains are an essential part of the internet infrastructure,
            as they provide a simple and memorable way for people to access websites and online services.
            They also help to establish brand identity and online presence for businesses and individuals.
